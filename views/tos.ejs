				<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
				<p>These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of all websites operated by XeonDB. (XeonDB, “Company”, “we”, or “us”), including xeondb.com, osv.io and seastar-project.org and any related sites through which XeonDB offers content, products, or services (collectively, the “Services”).

If you reside in the United States, your agreement is with XeonDB Inc. (US), and if you reside outside of the United States, your agreement is with XeonDB. (Australia)</p>
				<p>If you are using the Services on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, and “you” shall also refer to such entity. You must be of legal age (under applicable law) to form a binding contract to use the Services. These Terms incorporate by reference XeonDB's Privacy Policy and any other policies or guidelines that we may publish from time to time. XeonDB reserves the right to upgrade, modify or discontinue any part of the Services at any time. Your continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of such changes to the Services.</p>
				<h2>2. Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p>By accessing or using the Services, you expressly acknowledge and agree to be bound by our Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use, and protect your personal information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and will only use your information as described in the Privacy Policy. By using the Services, you consent to the collection and use of information as outlined in the Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy is incorporated into these Terms by reference.</p>
				<h2>3. Ownership of Content and Intellectual Property</h2>
				<p>All content, information, and materials available on or through the Services, including but not limited to text, software, documentation, code, databases, graphics, logos, trademarks, images, and audiovisual content (collectively, the “Content”), are owned by or licensed to XeonDB and are protected by intellectual property laws. XeonDB (or its licensors) retains all rights, title, and interest in and to the Content. You may not copy, reproduce, modify, distribute, transmit, display, perform, or create derivative works of any Content without XeonDB's prior written permission, except as allowed under these Terms.</p>
				<p>By submitting, uploading, or posting any code, questions, comments, suggestions, data, or other information (collectively, “User Submissions”) to the website, the community, any associated forums, or web applications, or any other platforms operated by or on behalf of XeonDB, you acknowledge and agree that such User Submissions shall become the sole and exclusive property of XeonDB. You hereby irrevocably assign, transfer, and convey to XeonDB all worldwide right, title, and interest in and to the User Submissions, including, without limitation, all related intellectual property rights and moral rights. XeonDB shall have the unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, and transferable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, display, perform, and commercially exploit the User Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, in any media now known or later developed, without any obligation of notice, attribution, or compensation to you or any third party.</p>
				<p>All XeonDB names, logos, and trademarks, as well as the look-and-feel of the Services, are trademarks or trade dress owned by XeonDB or its licensors. You are not granted any right or license to use any XeonDB trademarks or service marks by these Terms. Any third-party trademarks or logos appearing in the Services are the property of their respective owners, and you may not use them without permission from those owners.</p>
				<p>If you believe that any Content on our Services infringes your copyright or other intellectual property rights, please notify us promptly. Please send any copyright infringement notices to us via the contact information provided in Section 13 below, and include all necessary details to process your request.</p>
				<h2>4. License and Acceptable Use</h2>
				<h3>4.1 License Grant</h3>
				<p>XeonDB grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and make personal or internal business use of the Services and Content. This license is conditioned on your compliance with these Terms. You may use materials purposely made available by XeonDB for downloading (e.g. documentation or developer resources) for your personal or internal use, provided that you do not remove any proprietary notices, modify the materials, or make additional representations or warranties regarding the materials. All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by XeonDB and its licensors.</p>
				<h3>4.2 Acceptable Use</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Unauthorized Access or Disruption:</strong> Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion of the Services, other user accounts, or any systems or networks connected to the Services, including by hacking, password “mining” or any other illegitimate means. You may not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the Services or any network connected to the Services, nor breach any security or authentication measures. You also agree not to use any device, software, script, or routine to interfere with the proper operation of the Services or any activity being conducted on the Services.</li>
					<li><strong>Automated Retrieval (“Scraping”):</strong> Use any automatic or manual process, scraper, robot, or spider to access, query, or index the Services or Content to retrieve, harvest, or compile information for any purpose without XeonDB's express written permission. This prohibition does not restrict legitimate indexing by search engines or similar activities in accordance with our robots.txt file (if applicable).</li>
					<li><strong>Violation of Law or Rights:</strong> Use the Services or Content for any unlawful purpose, or to post, upload, transmit, or otherwise make available any content that is illegal, defamatory, harassing, abusive, fraudulent, infringing, or otherwise violates any law or regulation or any rights of others. This includes (without limitation) not using the Services in a way that infringes intellectual property rights of XeonDB or any third party, or that violates privacy, publicity, or other personal rights of others.</li>
					<li><strong>Malicious Activities:</strong> Introduce any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses, or other harmful or destructive code into the Services, or use the Services to distribute malware or perform cyberattacks (e.g. denial of service attacks) against us or any other parties. You are responsible for taking precautions to protect your own systems from viruses or other harmful content when accessing third-party content through our Services.</li>
					<li><strong>Circumvention and Misuse:</strong> Interfere with or circumvent any security or access control features of the Services, or otherwise use the Services in any manner that could disable, overburden, damage, or impair the Services (or the networks connected to the Services) or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Services. Additionally, you will not use the Services to send unauthorized or unsolicited advertising, junk or bulk e-mail (“spam”), chain letters, or any form of solicitation.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>XeonDB reserves the right (but has no obligation) to monitor usage of the Services and any user-submitted content to ensure compliance with these Terms. We may, at our sole discretion, suspend or terminate your access to the Services (or any portion thereof) without notice if we believe you have violated these Terms or applicable law (see Section 6 below).</p>
				<h2>5. Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
				<p><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> XeonDB may use third-party service providers and tools on or in connection with the Services (for example, analytics services, cloud hosting, payment processors, or social media plugins). By using our Services, you agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms of service associated with such tools or services that are incorporated into our Services. XeonDB is not responsible for the terms or policies of third-party services, and your use of those services may be governed by their own terms and privacy policies.</p>
				<p><strong>Links to External Sites:</strong> The Services may contain links to or integrations with third-party websites or resources that are not owned or controlled by XeonDB (collectively, “Third-Party Websites”). These links are provided for your convenience and reference only. XeonDB does not endorse and is not responsible for the content, products, services, or information on any Third-Party Websites. When you click on such links or access Third-Party Websites via our Services, you do so at your own risk. We make no warranties or representations about the accuracy or completeness of any content on Third-Party Websites, and you acknowledge that XeonDB shall have no liability for any damage or loss arising from your access to or use of any Third-Party Websites.</p>
				<p>Please note that Third-Party Websites may have their own terms of use and privacy policies, and we encourage you to review those documents when using such websites.</p>
				<h2>6. Termination</h2>
				<p>XeonDB reserves the right to terminate or suspend your access to all or any part of the Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without prior notice, effective immediately. This means that we may, for example, terminate your account or use of the Services if we believe you have violated these Terms or if we decide to discontinue the Services. XeonDB shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Services.</p>
				<p>If you wish to terminate this agreement, you may simply discontinue using the Services at any time. Upon any termination of your access or these Terms, for any reason: (a) the rights and licenses granted to you under these Terms will end; and (b) all provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall continue in effect. The surviving provisions include, without limitation, ownership of intellectual property, warranty disclaimers, indemnities, limitations of liability, and governing law.</p>
				<h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
				<p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. XeonDB, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and suppliers expressly disclaim all warranties and conditions of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade.</p>
				<p>In particular, XeonDB makes no warranty or representation that: (i) the Services will meet your requirements or expectations; (ii) your access to the Services will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; (iii) any results, output, or information that may be obtained from the use of the Services will be accurate, reliable, or complete; or (iv) any errors or defects in the Services will be corrected. XeonDB does not warrant that the Services, Content, or the servers that make them available are free of viruses or other harmful components. Any material or Content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Services is accessed at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download or use of any such material.</p>
				<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, so to that extent some of the above exclusions may not apply to you. In such cases, any statutory warranties shall be limited to the minimum warranty period permitted by law.</p>
				<p>You expressly represent and warrant that: (i) your access to and use of the Services will be in strict compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation data privacy laws and all applicable U.S. and Australian export control and sanctions laws; (ii) you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country subject to comprehensive U.S. or Australian sanctions; (iii) you own or have obtained all necessary rights, consents, and permissions to any content, data, or software you upload, process, or transmit via the Services, and such use will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or publicity rights of any third party; and (iv) you will not use the Services to transmit any viruses, malware, or harmful code, or to conduct any unauthorized vulnerability testing or security breaches.</p>
				<h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
				<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will XeonDB (or its officers, directors, employees, agents, suppliers, or licensors) be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages whatsoever. This includes, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, revenue, business, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses arising out of or related to your access to, or use of (or inability to use), the Services or any Content, even if XeonDB has previously been advised of or reasonably could have foreseen, the possibility of such damages, however they arise, whether in breach of contract or in tort (including negligence). Additionally, XeonDB will not be liable for: (i) use or inability to use the Services or the cost of procurement of substitute goods or services; (ii) any unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data, malicious or fraudulent transaction; (iii) any statements or conduct of any third party within the Services; (iv) any other matter relating to the Services beyond XeonDB's reasonable control or (v) any content or information you may download, use, modify or distribute.</p>
				<p><strong>Maximum Liability:</strong> Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, XeonDB's total cumulative liability to you for all claims arising from or related to the Services shall not exceed the total amount of US$100. This limitation is an essential part of the bargain between you and XeonDB, and it reflects a fair allocation of risk.</p>
				<p>Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for certain damages, in such jurisdictions XeonDB's liability will be limited to the smallest amount permitted by law. Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude or limit liability that cannot be excluded under law (for example, certain liabilities under applicable product liability or consumer protection laws).</p>
				<h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
				<p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless XeonDB, its affiliates, contractors, licensors, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, expenses, and costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to any claim, demand, allegation, or proceeding brought by any third party due to or arising out of: (a) your use of the Services; (b) your violation of these Terms; (c) your violation of any applicable law or regulation; or (d) your infringement or misappropriation of any intellectual property or other rights of any person or entity.</p>
				<p>XeonDB reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us. You agree to cooperate with XeonDB's defense of such claims. You further agree not to settle any such matter without the prior written consent of XeonDB. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.</p>
				<h2>10. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
				<p>These Terms and any dispute arising out of or in connection with the Services or these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Australia, excluding its conflict of law principles. You agree that all legal claims or disputes between you and XeonDB will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts located in Tel Aviv, Australia. You and XeonDB each consent to personal jurisdiction in such courts and waive any objections based on inconvenient forum or any other jurisdictional grounds.</p>
				<p>If you are accessing or using the Services from outside Australia, you are responsible for complying with local laws and regulations. You may not use the Services if you are a resident of any country embargoed by Australia or the United States, or if you are on any restricted parties lists under applicable export control laws. In particular, you represent that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country to which use of the Services is prohibited by applicable sanctions or export laws (including U.S. sanctions).</p>
				<h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
				<p>XeonDB may revise or update these Terms from time to time at its sole discretion. We will post any updated Terms on our website and indicate the date of the latest revision at the top of the Terms. It is your responsibility to check this page periodically for changes. If you continue to use the Services after any changes to the Terms are posted, you agree that your continued use constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree to a change, you must stop using the Services. Except for changes made by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of XeonDB.</p>
				<h2>12. Miscellaneous</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms (including any documents incorporated by reference, such as the Privacy Policy) constitute the entire agreement between you and XeonDB regarding your use of the Services, and supersede any prior agreements between you and us on the same subject matter. Any additional or different terms in any purchase order, communication or other document are void, unless agreed to in writing by an authorized representative of XeonDB.</li>
					<li><strong>No Waiver:</strong> No failure or delay by XeonDB in exercising any right, power, or remedy under these Terms shall operate as a waiver of any such right or remedy, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or remedy by XeonDB preclude any other or further exercise of that or any other right, power, or remedy. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by the party granting the waiver.</li>
					<li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith a valid, enforceable substitute provision that most nearly effects the parties’ original intent and achieves the same economic effect as the invalid provision.</li>
					<li><strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign or transfer these Terms (or any of your rights or obligations under these Terms) without XeonDB's prior written consent. Any attempted assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void. XeonDB may freely assign or transfer these Terms or delegate its obligations without notice or consent. These Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.</li>
					<li><strong>No Third-Party Beneficiaries:</strong> These Terms are for the benefit of the parties (you and XeonDB) and are not intended to confer any rights or benefits on any third party. No third party shall have any rights to enforce any term of this Agreement.</li>
					<li><strong>Relationship of the Parties:</strong> You and XeonDB are independent contractors under these Terms. These Terms do not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary, or employment relationship between the parties.</li>
					<li><strong>Headings:</strong> Section headings in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</li>
